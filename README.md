## Background Effect

As part of the project, I added a cool background effect using dynamic, colorful lights that move around the screen. These lights are generated using JavaScript and styled with CSS, creating an engaging and interactive visual experience. The lights are created with random colors and positions, and they animate in a smooth, fluid motion across the screen, giving a glowing, futuristic effect to the background.
